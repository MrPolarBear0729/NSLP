## S1 Fig:Distribution of features
When exploring the potential association between biological networks and synthetic lethal gene pairs, 86 features are extracted from both network and biological perspectives, including 72 features related to gene expression and mutation. Affected by the space, only the merged gene-pair mutation coverage, the merged gene-pair co-mutation rate and the merged gene-pair differential expression score are shown. The remaining 23 cancer types have gene-pair mutation coverage, co-mutation rates and differential expression scores are presented here.

## S2 Fig:The PR curve for models
In response to the pan-cancer and colorectal cancer cases, we have separately plotted PR curves for different models to demonstrate their performance. Subfigure A illustrates the performance in the pan-cancer case, while subfigure B represents the performance in the colorectal cancer case.
## S1 table:Significance of features
We used the Wilcoxon rank sum test to infer whether the two population distributions from which the samples are drawn differ. The threshold of the p-value is 0.05.

## S2 table:Prediction of gene sensitivity to drugs in the context of colon cancer
This table shows 23 pairs of synthetic lethal gene combinations associated with 20 cancer drugs, and their IC50 values in cell lines with mutations in the synthetic lethal partner of the target gene are significantly lower than those of the target gene by Wilcoxon rank sum test Synthetic lethal partner mutation-free cell lines.
